# Convert2SNN
Tool for converting conventional neural networks to spiking neural networks.

## About
This tool can be used to convert and optimize conventional neural networks that were trained in TensorFlow to spiking neural networks (SNN).

**Currently under construction. Please check again later until everything is implemented.**
